## User Story

```
FEAT-127: Implement OpenTelemetry-Compatible Logging System
```

### Description
As a developer, I need a standardized logging system that follows OpenTelemetry specifications so that I can gain comprehensive observability across our application components and integrate with modern monitoring platforms.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement core logging interfaces compatible with OpenTelemetry's log data model
2. Create specialized logger factories for components, operations, and HTTP requests
3. Support both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) environments
4. Integrate with W3C Trace Context for distributed tracing
5. Implement automatic resource detection for service and runtime information
6. Support multiple log transports (console, file, OpenTelemetry) configurable via environment variables
7. Add sensitive data redaction capabilities
8. Include structured event and metric logging
9. Provide Remix-specific logging utilities for loaders and actions
10. Update documentation with usage examples and best practices

### Technical Details
- Use Pino as the underlying logging engine with appropriate transport plugins
- Implement OpenTelemetry's Log Record schema
- Support configuration through environment variables with sensible defaults
- Create integration points with OpenTelemetry SDK for trace context propagation
- Ensure backwards compatibility with existing logging calls
- Add TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for improved developer experience

### Business Value
This feature will improve application reliability and issue resolution by providing standardized, context-rich logs across all application components. The OpenTelemetry compatibility ensures our observability data can be sent to various monitoring platforms, avoiding vendor lock-in and allowing more sophisticated analysis of application behavior, errors, and performance.
