Using `index.ts` as the root file for each module in your Remix app is generally a good approach. This follows the concept of "barrel exports" which is a common pattern in TypeScript projects.

The benefits of this approach include:

1. **Clean imports**: It allows you to import from the module name rather than specific files
   ```typescript
   // With index.ts as entry point
   import { ViteEnv } from "~/core/ViteEnv";
   
   // Without index.ts, you'd need
   import { ViteEnv } from "~/core/ViteEnv/manager";
   ```

2. **Encapsulation**: It lets you control which parts of your module are exposed publicly while keeping internal implementations private

3. **Refactoring flexibility**: You can change the internal structure of your module without breaking imports in other parts of your application

4. **Documentation**: The index.ts file serves as a clear entry point that shows what functionality the module provides

This approach is also aligned with Node.js module resolution, where importing a directory looks for an `index.js` (or `index.ts` in TypeScript) file by default.

For your ViteEnv implementation specifically, having an index.ts that exports only what should be publicly available (like the `ViteEnv`, `setEnv`, and `debugEnv` functions) while keeping implementation details private is a clean architectural pattern.

The only caution would be to avoid creating "barrel files" that import and re-export a large number of unrelated components, as that can negatively impact tree-shaking and bundle size.
