Here's the continuation of the ViteEnv implementation:

Now I'll explain the solution I've developed to solve the circular dependency issue between ViteEnv and LogManager while maintaining structured logging throughout the application.

## The Problem: Circular Dependency

The error you encountered, "Cannot access 'ViteEnv' before initialization," occurred because:

1. ViteEnv needed to import LogManager for structured logging
2. LogManager needed to import ViteEnv for configuration
3. This created a circular dependency where neither module could initialize first

## The Solution: Configuration Module Pattern

I've implemented a solution using the **Configuration Module Pattern**, which introduces a shared configuration layer that breaks the circular dependency:

1. **Shared Environment Configuration** (`app/core/config/environment.ts`):
   - Acts as a basic environment variable loader with minimal dependencies
   - Provides raw environment values and simple helper functions
   - Contains shared defaults for both ViteEnv and LogManager
   - Includes a simple `safeLog` function for structured logging during initialization

2. **Updated ViteEnv** (`app/core/ViteEnv/index.ts`):
   - Imports from the shared config module instead of LogManager
   - Uses `safeLog` for structured logging during initialization
   - Still provides all the same functionality as before

3. **Updated LogManager** (`app/core/Observability/logs.ts`):
   - Imports from the shared config module instead of ViteEnv
   - Uses the same default values as ViteEnv
   - Maintains all its functionality

4. **Integration Example** (`app/core/Observability/index.ts`):
   - Safely imports from ViteEnv after initialization
   - Uses the fully configured logger for structured logging
   - Initializes OpenTelemetry based on ViteEnv settings

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Circular Dependencies**: Each module imports only from the shared config
2. **Consistent Configuration**: Both modules use the same defaults
3. **Structured Logging Throughout**: All logs use structured format
4. **Safe Initialization**: Everything initializes in the correct order
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All original features still work

## How to Implement

1. Create the shared configuration module first
2. Update ViteEnv to use the shared config
3. Update LogManager to use the shared config
4. Update other modules that depend on both

This approach follows the well-established dependency inversion principle, where both high-level modules depend on abstractions rather than directly on each other.

With this implementation, you can use proper structured logging throughout your application, including during ViteEnv initialization, without running into circular dependency issues.


You're absolutely right! The same circular dependency issue will affect the OpenTelemetry module as well, since it would also need to import from ViteEnv for configuration.

Let's apply the same pattern to the OpenTelemetry module to resolve the circular dependency:

Let me finish by explaining how I've resolved the OpenTelemetry module's circular dependency issue as well:

## Complete Solution for All Circular Dependencies

I've updated all three components to work together without circular dependencies:

1. **Shared Environment Configuration** (`app/core/config/environment.ts`):
   - Central source of truth for raw environment variables
   - Contains default values for logging and OpenTelemetry
   - Provides helper functions for basic structured logging during initialization
   - Shared by all core modules

2. **ViteEnv Module** (`app/core/ViteEnv/index.ts`):
   - Uses shared environment configuration
   - Uses safe logging functions that don't depend on other modules
   - Provides the fully typed and validated environment variables

3. **LogManager Module** (`app/core/Observability/logs.ts`):
   - Also uses shared environment configuration
   - Configures advanced logging based on raw environment values
   - Can now be imported by other modules without circular dependencies

4. **OpenTelemetry Module** (`app/core/Observability/opentelemetry.ts`):
   - Also uses shared environment configuration
   - Configures OpenTelemetry using direct environment values
   - Uses safe structured logging during initialization

5. **Integration Module** (`app/core/Observability/index.ts`):
   - Safely imports ViteEnv after initialization
   - Properly initializes OpenTelemetry if enabled
   - Exports all observability functionality

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clean Dependency Graph**: The circular dependency is completely resolved
2. **Structured Logging Everywhere**: Even the initialization logs are structured
3. **Consistent Configuration**: All modules use the same configuration sources
4. **Order-Independent Initialization**: Modules can be loaded in any order
5. **Proper Type Safety**: All environment variables maintain their type definitions
6. **Seamless Integration**: The rest of the application can use both modules normally

This solution follows best practices for dependency management in large applications:

- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Configuration values are defined only once
- **Fail-Fast Initialization**: Errors are caught early with proper logging

With this implementation, you can have proper structured logging, OpenTelemetry tracing, and sophisticated environment variable management throughout your application without any circular dependency issues.
