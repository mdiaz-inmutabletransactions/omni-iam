# ViteEnv: Future Feature Roadmap
0.1.0-beta.1 

This document outlines potential future enhancements and features for the ViteEnv environment management system.


## External Schema Configuration: 
- [ ] This feature would allow defining the schema in external configuration files (JSON/YAML), with support for:
  - [ ]  Loading schemas, 
  - [ ]  Merging schemas, 
  - [ ]  Versioning schemas,
  - [ ]  Extending schemas.

## Opinionated Core Schema Standards: This implements mandatory standards for:

- [ ] LOCALE handling with strict ISO language-region code validation
- [ ] TIMEZONE handling with IANA timezone identifier support
- [ ] A merging mechanism that ensures core standards take precedence over custom schemas

## Highest Priority Features

### 0. External Schema Definition & Core Standards

- [ ] **External Schema Configuration**
  - [ ] Implement JSON/YAML schema configuration file support
  - [ ] Create schema loading and merging mechanism
  - [ ] Support schema extension and overrides
  - [ ] Add versioning for schema definitions

- [ ] **Opinionated Core Schema Standards**
  - [ ] Implement mandatory LOCALE handling with strict validation
    - [ ] Support for all ISO language-region codes (e.g., en-US, es-MX)
    - [ ] Built-in validation against official ISO standards
    - [ ] Default fallback mechanism for missing locales
  - [ ] Implement mandatory TIMEZONE handling
    - [ ] Support for all IANA timezone identifiers
    - [ ] Runtime validation against current IANA database
    - [ ] Offset calculation and DST awareness
    - [ ] Default UTC fallback for missing timezone
  - [ ] Merge external schema with core opinionated schema
    - [ ] Core schema takes precedence for critical variables
    - [ ] Custom schema extends but cannot override core standards
    - [ ] Validation reporting for schema conflicts

## High Priority Features

### 1. Enhanced Schema Validation

- [ ] Add support for more complex validation rules (regex patterns, min/max values)
- [ ] Implement custom error messages for validation failures
- [ ] Add schema validation for nested objects and arrays
- [ ] Implement conditional validation (validate some fields based on others)

### 2. Environment Variable Groups

- [ ] Add support for logical grouping of related variables
- [ ] Implement namespacing for environment variables
- [ ] Create helper functions for accessing grouped variables
- [ ] Add visual grouping in debug output

### 3. Improved Error Handling and Reporting

- [ ] Create centralized error logging for environment variable issues
- [ ] Add warning levels (critical, warning, info)
- [ ] Implement application startup validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Add suggestions for fixing common environment errors

## Medium Priority Features

### 4. Runtime Configuration UI

- [ ] Create an admin panel for viewing/editing environment variables
- [ ] Add permission system for environment management
- [ ] Implement history tracking for environment changes
- [ ] Add environment comparison between environments

### 5. Enhanced Testing Support

- [ ] Create test-specific environment snapshots
- [ ] Add environment mocking utilities for unit tests
- [ ] Implement environment assertion helpers
- [ ] Create environment scenario presets

### 6. Environment Encryption

- [ ] Add support for encrypted environment variables
- [ ] Implement key rotation for encrypted values
- [ ] Create utilities for secure environment sharing
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive variable access

## Lower Priority Features

### 7. Multi-environment Configuration

- [ ] Support for environment inheritance hierarchies
- [ ] Implement environment composition patterns
- [ ] Add feature flag integration with environments
- [ ] Create deployment-specific environment configurations

### 8. Documentation Enhancements

- [ ] Generate environment documentation from schema
- [ ] Create visual diagrams of environment relationships
- [ ] Add interactive examples in documentation
- [ ] Implement versioned environment documentation

### 9. Integration Improvements

- [ ] Add plugins for popular frameworks and tools
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline integrations
- [ ] Implement environment migration utilities
- [ ] Add cloud provider integrations (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### 10. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize environment variable loading
- [ ] Implement lazy-loading for large environment sets
- [ ] Add caching layer for transformed variables
- [ ] Reduce startup time with environment pre-processing

### 11. Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Refactor for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Implement plugin architecture for extensibility
- [ ] Create standalone package for sharing across projects
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit test coverage

## Community and Ecosystem

### 12. Open Source Development

- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Set up public repository with proper documentation
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning
- [ ] Create community examples and starter templates

### 13. Integrations with External Services

- [ ] Add support for remote configuration services
- [ ] Implement feature flag service integrations
- [ ] Create adapters for configuration management systems
- [ ] Add support for distributed environment management

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in contributing to any of these features, please:

1. Create an issue in the repository discussing your implementation plan
2. Reference the feature from this roadmap in your proposal
3. Submit a pull request with your implementation
4. Update the roadmap to check off completed items

## Priority Levels

- **High Priority**: Features that will provide immediate value and address current limitations
- **Medium Priority**: Features that enhance the system but aren't critical for basic functionality
- **Lower Priority**: Features that provide specialized functionality or quality-of-life improvements

## Feature Requests
